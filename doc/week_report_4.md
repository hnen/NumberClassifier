# Week Report 4

## Week Summary

Total hours worked: 9,5 hours

This week I implemented bit more user interface GUI for all functionality of the app. It's still quite heavily work in progress though. A lot of time was spent to cleaning up the code, writing javadoc and improving test coverage.

Next week I'm planning to make the GUI more usable, improve the algorithms and make more rigorous and systematic performance/accuracy testing.
