# App Manual

## Quick start

The GitHub project uploads the latest jar `app.jar` automatically. There is link in GitHub front page, or they can be found for GitHub Actions tab.

If you want to build the project yourself, you should have JDK 16 in your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. Other versions may work too, but cannot guarantee it. Easiest way to build the project is to run `./gradlew build` in `NumberClassifier` directory.
