# Week Report 6

## Week Summary

Total hours worked: 

This week I caught up with all the tech debt that had accumulated, like missing unit testing. Also lot of time went into finalizing documentation.

The project is somewhat ready, the application is working and gives results. Some documentation is missing and not finalized. During the this course I learned a lot about neural networks, and now I would do many things differently. A lot of the implementation was improvised based on high-level resources available on internet and Youtube, without any prior experience on neural nets or libraries, so the algorithm may work a bit differently than they are usally done. Naming may be a bit random here and there. Anyway, as a learning project I'm happy with the goal, i.e. I learned a lot from the project. However I wouldn't use the project as a reference for other implementations or wouldn't develop it further without major changes.
