# Week Report 2

Total: TODO

## Wed 27.7.2022 - 0,5 hours
 - Starting to draft the most central data structure, FeedForwardNeuralNetwork
 - Wrote first test for the FeedForwardNeuralNetwork, evaluating the XOR function from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network#/media/File:XOR_perceptron_net.png

 ## Thu 28.7.2022 - 4 hours
 - Continuing to implement FeedForwardNeuralNetwork
 - Experimenting manually with different activation functions and biases, to make the XOR network to give correct results.
   - Learning how activation functions, weights and biases change the output of the network.
 - Add test code coverage badge and report download link to README.md
 - Studying about backpropagation
 - Starting to draft backpropagation algorithm.

## Fri 29.7.2022
 - Implementing backpropagation.
   - The implementation is not very efficient, but the focus at this point is in clarity, and to "just to make it work." Plan is to optimize later, by e.g. changing computations to use efficient linear algebra library.
