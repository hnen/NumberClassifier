# Week Report 2

Total: TODO

## Wed 27.7.2022 - 0,5 hours
 - Starting to draft the most central data structure, FeedForwardNeuralNetwork
 - Wrote first test for the FeedForwardNeuralNetwork, evaluating the XOR function from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network#/media/File:XOR_perceptron_net.png

 ## Thu 28.7.2022 - 1 hour
 - Continuing to implement FeedForwardNeuralNetwork
 - Experimenting manually with different activation functions and biases, to make the XOR network to give correct results.
 - Rename FeedForwardNeuralNetwork to MultilayerPerceptron, as it seems to be common term used in literature for this kind of neural network.
