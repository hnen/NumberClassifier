# Week Report 4

## Week Summary

Total hours worked: 6 hours

I had bit hard time with my schedule this week, so wasn't able to work on the project as much as I would've wanted to.

That said, I made some progress in performance testing. The app outputs results, accuracy and time used into a CSV file, which hopefully makes it easier to compare the accuracy and speed of the traning between different parameters and methods. Also, a lot of time was spent on studying on how to improve the training and experimenting with differnet weight initalization methods.
