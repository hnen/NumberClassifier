# Project definition

My study programme is "Tietojenk√§sittelytieteen kandiohjelma".

Project will be written in Java. I'm also capable to peer review projects written in C++, C# and Python. I'll use English as documentation language.

Aim of the project is to recognize hand-written numbers. For this problem, I'm planning to implement basic feedforward neural network data structure. For learning the input set I'm planning to implement simple backpropagation algorithm.

While artificial neural network may be a bit overkill solution for the problem, I chose to implement it due to personal interest on the topic. Modern AIs and what they are capable of fascinates me, and to my understanding, most of them use some sort of artificial neural network. I thought this would be a great opportunity to gain some insight on basic principles of this machine learning method.

For learning the numbers, program will receive a set of pictures paired with the number as an input, for which output will be neural network parameters that can be used to classify new pictures to numbers they represent. Program will take also various hyperparameters as an input. 

For classification, program will receive a picture and neural network parameters generated with learning algorithm. The program will feed the picture to a neural network defined by the input parameters, and output the classification that the neural network produces.
